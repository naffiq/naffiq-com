    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Galymzhan Abdugalimov and I'm software developer, working in
      Haarlem, Netherlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite having rich backend development experience, I recently switched to
      React/React Native development. I use TypeScript for commercial
      development, but use plain ES6 for personal projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to keep everything in JS, I started developing backend for my
      apps using NodeJS and GraphQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      I play and compose some music in my spare time, but far from publishing
      it.
    </p>
  </div>
